Hey there, I'm Liz! I am a Chicana from Southern California, with roots from Zacatecas, MÃ©xico. I became interested in ecology while studying abroad in Australia, wading through muddy seagrass beds. My independent research on intertidal purple sea urchins along the Monterey Bay Peninsula fueled my interest in ecological modeling and community dynamics. Recently, I successfully defended my Master's thesis on the scales of influence on
plant phenological responses across the U.S., using open and multi-sourced data.\
\
In my free time, you can find me entranced by a rock or mushroom, crafting, or free diving.\
