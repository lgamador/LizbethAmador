**My levels of privileges:** I am white-passing Chicana from Southern California. I am a first generation college graduate and second generation immigrant, from Zacatecas, México. My first language is Spanish and I was raised in a predominately immigrant community. I am neurodivergent, left handed, and am able-bodied. I am a renter, have access to a car and public transportation, and am a U.S. citizen. \
\
I acknowledge that there continues to be inequities based on gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, age, parental status, disability, or other factors. I also understand that work done to uplift JDEI efforts in STEM should not only rely on BIPOC and historically marginalized groups. Inclusive and diverse spaces requires active work to continuously inform myself on the joys and struggles of minority groups.\
\
In my career, I aim to foster a diverse, inclusive, and equitable scientific community through safe space and culture creating practices. Additionally, I adopt concepts of [indigenous](https://operations.du.edu/inclusive-teaching/native-american-pedagogies) and [cariño](https://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1096&context=ctlle) pedagogues to foster belonging and community.\
