## Career Interests

I am interested in the use of long-term monitoring methods towards coastal and terrestrial ecosystems, and spatial-temporal questions. I am experienced with various statistical and geospatial software. I am looking to apply my skills with ecological data and remote sensing to scientific outreach projects!\
\
I have conducted research across different fields and systems, studying marine ecology along the Monterey Peninsula and terrestrial plant phenology across the contiguous U.S. I have ventured from the western rocky intertidals to the bogs in the North East.
